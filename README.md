# ToDoList-Ejs-mongoDB-
simple todolist web application using ejs ,node.js and mongodb


# How to create/select a List?
simply by adding the list name after the web application link, just after the "/" mark and you will redirect to that list.
there is a default list which is the list you see when you go the main route of the application, on that list you can see the day and the date,and you can add items to it just like the other lists but the code implementation for the main list is a little bit different.

# How to add/remove items to the list?
 -to add items:you can type the task you want to add in the text box,then you may press the enter key or click on the "+" button.
 -to remove items:just check the box to the left of the item you want to delete and it will immediately delete that item.
